Summarize the TinyOS lecture. Describe the basic concept of TinyOS (components, modules, configurations, wiring, commands, signals, signatures, interfaces, generic interfaces, generic components) briefly and using your own words.

# Introduction
## What is TinyOS?
1. TinyOS is an open source operating system for embedded, low power,wireless devices.

2. Component-based
3. Event-driven
4. Portable
5. Robust

## Why use TinyOS?
1. Great performance under limited resources
2. Broad platform coverage
3. Rich protocol library
4. Powerful PC-side tools

## TinyOS Design Goals

# Structural Model
## The nesC Programming Language
## Component Structure
## Components
Components are something like entities. Every component encapsulates its own functions and they can provide other components services through interfaces. 

## Modules
A module are used to define the behaviors of a compoment. That is, modules define functions. 

## Configurations
A configuration shows how components are connected(wired) in a program.

## Wiring
Wiring(->) means connecting providers and users together. For example, module A uses an interface called Leds. However, if we don't declare the provider of the interface Leds, the commands in Leds would be undefined. So we declare a provider called LedsC. Now, we can use 
> A.Leds -> LedsC
to connect LedsC(provider) with A(User).

## Commands
Commands are just like the concept of functions in C programming language.

## Signals
A signal means, when a function goes into some special conditions(e.g. an exception happened or some command is completed), the function can emit a signal(use signal keyword) to its caller.

## Signatures
Signatures are declarations.

## Interfaces
Interfaces list the commands it can excute and the events it can emit(signal).

## Generic Interfaces

## Generic components
Normally a component is an instance which cannot be changed. On the contrast, a generic component can be instantiated within a configuration. While a component can be seen as an object in object oriented language, a generic component can be seen as a non-static class.
