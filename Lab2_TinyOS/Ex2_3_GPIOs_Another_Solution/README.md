# Control  of  GPIO  Pins
At http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~bibyk/ee582/telosMote.pdf you can find the schematic of the TelosB mote.  To which GPIO pins are the LEDs connected, and how does the software control these pins? Modify the Blink application so that the control of the LEDs is performed without the LedsC component.  Use direct control of the state of the GPIO pins instead.
